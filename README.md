# LLM-Bias
This repository hosts my Master’s research paper analyzing bias behavior in modern LLMs and multimodal models.  The project reproduces and evaluates established benchmarks using updated models, highlighting shifts in bias patterns, dataset limitations, and the trade-offs between model effectiveness and fairness.

This project was conducted as part of a collaborative research effort.

The original experimental codebase and implementation were developed in a shared repository whcih can be found here: LLMBias
