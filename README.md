# LLM-Bias
This repository hosts my Master’s research paper analyzing bias behavior in modern LLMs and multimodal models.  The project reproduces and evaluates established benchmarks using updated models, highlighting shifts in bias patterns, dataset limitations, and the trade-offs between model effectiveness and fairness.
